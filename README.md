1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS)

   Android

2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift)

   Framework: Flutter Programming language: Dart
   
3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development

   Yes. Since I intend to develop with Flutter, I may be interested in exploring cross-platform development. Flutter is an open source framework developed by Google for building cross-platform mobile, web, and desktop applications.
   
4. Include a brief explanation for your selections

   I used to use Flutter during undergraduate studies. Flutter allows developers to use a single code base to build applications for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web and desktop. This greatly reduces the effort of developing and maintaining versions for different platforms.
   And Flutter has excellent performance and smooth user experience by using its own rendering engine to draw the application interface.
   Also, as an open source project developed by Google, Flutter gets strong support and continuous updates with good community and documentation support.
